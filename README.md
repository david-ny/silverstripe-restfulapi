# SilverStripe RESTful API

This is a fork of [colymba/silverstripe-restfulapi](https://github.com/colymba/silverstripe-restfulapi)  

made compatible with Silverstripe 4. I use the base classes, token auth and the basic serializer for [silverstripe-fileshare]
(https://github.com/david-ny/silverstripe-fileshare).  

Other parts are not tested for SS4 compatibility.  
I also commented out the routing section in _config/config.yml.
